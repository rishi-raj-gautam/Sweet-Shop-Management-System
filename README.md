## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a real-world, production-ready application that:
- Supports multiple user roles (Admin & User)
- Manages inventory efficiently
- Follows clean coding practices
- Applies Test-Driven Development (TDD) for backend enhancements
- Uses modern deployment workflows

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- User authentication using JWT
- Role-based access control (Admin / User)
- Sweet inventory management
- Purchase and restock functionality
- Search and filter sweets
- Secure API communication
- Clean UI with reusable components
- Automated backend testing
- Deployed and accessible online

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

This is a **full-stack application** consisting of:

- **Frontend**: Handles user interaction, UI rendering, authentication flow, and API consumption  
- **Backend**: Handles business logic, authentication, authorization, data persistence, and validation  

📌 **Detailed explanations of the frontend and backend implementations are provided in their respective folders:**
- `frontend/README.md`
- `backend/README.md`

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (High-Level)

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest
- **Deployment**:
  - Frontend: Vercel
  - Backend: Render

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

The backend was initially implemented and validated manually.  
After stabilization, **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** was applied for new features and edge cases.

The project follows the **Red → Green → Refactor** cycle:
1. Write a failing test
2. Implement minimal logic to pass the test
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

This approach is reflected clearly in the Git commit history.

## 🤖 AI Usage Disclosure

AI tools were used responsibly during development.

### How AI Was Used
- Debugging and configuring Jest & test environments
- Understanding and applying TDD on an existing codebase
- Improving error handling and architectural decisions
- UI and UX ideation

All AI-assisted commits include proper **AI co-authorship**, and final implementations were manually reviewed and understood.
